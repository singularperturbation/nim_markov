Demo / example.

Go is example from the Go codewalk - will be doing same functionality (read input
and generate text from that input), but idiomatic in Nim version.

To illustrate use of generics, will implement queue data structure to store
prefixes.  For now, just read line-by-line and word-by-word with built in
iterators.

TODO:
Will implement buffered I/O using the lexbase and streams packages, and set up
tests using the unittest package. Nimscript (config.nims file) will be used to
configure package build / test commands.
