Go is example from the Go codewalk - will be doing same functionality (read input
and generate text from that input), but idiomatic in Nim version.

Will implement buffered I/O using the lexbase and streams packages, and set up
tests using the unittest package. Nimscript (config.nims file) will be used to
configure package build / test commands.

To illustrate use of generics, will implement queue data structure to store
prefixes.
